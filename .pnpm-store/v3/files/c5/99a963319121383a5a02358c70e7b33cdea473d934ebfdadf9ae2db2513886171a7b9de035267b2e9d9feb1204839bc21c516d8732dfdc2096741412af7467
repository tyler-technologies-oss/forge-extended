## Stylelint Rules

This repository contains default `stylelint` rules for Tyler Technologies, Inc. repositories.

## Usage

Install:

```bash
$ npm install -D @tylertech/stylelint-rules
```

Create a new `.stylelintrc` file in the root of your project and provide the default configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": "@tylertech/stylelint-rules"
}
```

> Rules can be overridden as needed by specifying the rule and value as you would usually for [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).
