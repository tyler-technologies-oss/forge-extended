<Title />

Confirmation dialogs convey a brief message or alert. For alerts that are one sentence or less, the dialog title can be excluded. They may be closed by clicking outside of the dialog, or by clicking a dismissive action. These dialogs display the same in mobile and desktop contexts.

This component is just a layout component and does not open a dialog for you. The confirmation-dialog component should be placed within your own forge-dialog.
