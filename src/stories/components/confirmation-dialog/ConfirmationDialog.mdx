<Title />

Confirmation dialogs are designed to convey a brief message or alert, up to 2 sentences. For alerts that are a single sentence, the dialog title can be excluded. They may be closed by clicking outside of the dialog, pressing escape, or by clicking a dismissive action. These dialogs display the same in mobile and desktop contexts.
