<app-demo-card headerText="Tyler Forge™ Extended - Angular Adapter">
  <p>
    Welcome to the Tyler Forge™ Extended Angular adapter library. This application serves as a demo application for
    consuming Tyler Forge™ extended web components in Angular.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library contains helper components, services, directives... etc. to aid in the consumption of Tyler Forge™
    extended web components. Although the adapter library is not necessary to use the Tyler Forge™ components, it does
    reduce the amount of boilerplate code that is required to use certain components, as well just making them easier to
    consume in general in Angular.
