<app-demo-card headerText="Tyler Forge™ Extended - Angular Adapter">
  <p>
    Welcome to the Forge Angular adapter library. This application serves as a demo application for consuming Forge web
    components in Angular with the help of the Angular adapter library.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library contains helper components, services, directives... etc. to aid in the consumption of Forge web
    components. Although the adapter library is not necessary to use the Forge components, it does reduce the amount of
    boilerplate code that is required to use certain components, as well just making them easier to consume in general.
