# Svelte

Svelte has [decent support](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#svelte) for custom elements and can mostly be used without a problem.

## Installation

To use Forge Extended in your Svelte application, install the following package from npm:

```bash
npm install @tylertech/forge-extended
```

## Importing Components

To use Forge Extended components in your Svelte application, import the components you need from the `@tylertech/forge-extended` package.

```svelte
<script>
  import '@tylertech/forge-extended/responsive-toolbar';
</script>

<forge-responsive-toolbar></forge-responsive-toolbar>
```

## TypeScript Support

If you are using TypeScript in your Svelte application, we also include typings for all Forge Extended components. You can add a reference to those
typings in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@tylertech/forge-extended/dist/types/svelte/forge-extended-svelte.d.ts"]
  }
}
```
