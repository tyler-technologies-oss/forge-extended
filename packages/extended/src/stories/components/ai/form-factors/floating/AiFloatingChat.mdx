<Title>AI Floating Chat</Title>

The AI Floating Chat component is a structured form factor component that provides a complete floating chat interface with built-in composition of `ai-dialog` and `ai-chat-interface` components. This component handles all the wiring and event management automatically, providing an easy-to-use solution for common floating chat use cases.

## Features

- **Structured composition**: Combines ai-dialog and ai-chat-interface components automatically
- **Built-in event handling**: Manages expand/minimize/open/close events internally
- **Responsive behavior**: Adapts to different viewport sizes automatically
- **Customizable slots**: Supports slotting messages, suggestions, and custom prompt components
- **Rich API**: Provides methods and events for programmatic control

## When to Use

Use the AI Floating Chat component when you want:

- A quick, easy-to-implement floating chat interface
- Standard floating chat behavior without custom positioning logic
- Built-in responsive behavior and event handling
- A component that "just works" out of the box

For more complex compositions or custom containers, consider using the atomic `ai-dialog` and `ai-chat-interface` components directly.
