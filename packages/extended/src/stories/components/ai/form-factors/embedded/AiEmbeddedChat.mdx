<Title>AI Embedded Chat</Title>

The AI Embedded Chat component is a structured form factor component that provides an embedded chat interface for inline page usage with built-in composition of `ai-gradient-container` and `ai-chat-interface` components. This component handles all the wiring and event management automatically, providing an easy-to-use solution for embedded chat interfaces that can expand to modal view when needed.

## Features

- **Structured composition**: Combines ai-gradient-container and ai-chat-interface components automatically
- **Dual view modes**: Renders embedded inline content that can expand to modal view
- **Built-in event handling**: Manages expand/collapse events and modal interactions internally
- **Gradient theming**: Supports multiple gradient intensity variants (low, medium, high, disabled)
- **Expandable interface**: Built-in expand functionality to switch from embedded to modal view
- **Customizable slots**: Supports slotting messages, suggestions, and custom prompt components
- **Rich API**: Provides methods and events for programmatic control

## When to Use

Use the AI Embedded Chat component when you want:

- A chat interface embedded directly in page content
- Ability to expand the chat to a larger modal view for better focus
- Built-in gradient theming and visual polish
- Standard embedded chat behavior without custom container logic
- A component that seamlessly transitions between embedded and modal states
- A component that "just works" out of the box

For more complex compositions or custom containers, consider using the atomic `ai-gradient-container`, `ai-modal`, and `ai-chat-interface` components directly.

## Usage Patterns

### Embedded Mode (Default)

The component renders as an embedded chat interface within the `ai-gradient-container`, perfect for inline page content. Users can expand to modal view using the expand button in the chat header.

### Modal Mode (Expanded)

When expanded, the chat interface moves to a modal overlay powered by `ai-modal`, providing a focused chat experience. The modal includes minimize functionality to return to embedded mode.
