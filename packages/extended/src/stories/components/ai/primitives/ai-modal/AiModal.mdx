<Title />

The AI Modal component provides a basic modal dialog implementation using the native HTML `<dialog>` element. This component is designed to be a simple, foundational modal that can be extended for more specific use cases.

## Basic Usage

The AI Modal renders content within a standard HTML dialog element and provides programmatic control through the `open` property and `show()`/`close()` methods.

<Canvas of={AiModalStories.Demo} />

## Opening and Closing

The modal can be controlled in several ways:

- **Property**: Set the `open` property to `true` or `false`
- **Attribute**: Add or remove the `open` attribute
- **Methods**: Call `show()` to open or `close()` to close the modal

## Content

All content is provided through slots, giving you complete control over the modal's internal structure and styling. The component provides no default content - everything must be provided by the consumer.

## API

<CustomArgTypes />

## Accessibility

This component uses the native HTML `<dialog>` element, which provides built-in accessibility features including:

- Proper focus management
- Keyboard navigation (Escape key to close)
- Screen reader compatibility
- Backdrop interaction handling

Make sure to provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions for your modal content to ensure full accessibility compliance.
