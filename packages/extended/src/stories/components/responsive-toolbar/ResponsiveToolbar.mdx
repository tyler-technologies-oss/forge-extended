<Title />

The Responsive Toolbar dynamically adjusts your toolbar content to prevent overlap on smaller screens. It leverages a `ResizeObserver` to detect when the title content collides with the end slot content. When an overlap is detected, the toolbar automatically hides the `desktop-actions` slot and displays the `mobile-actions` slot instead.

This approach eliminates the need for manually configuring breakpoints or container queries, ensuring a seamless adaptive experience without extra calculations. Simply provide your `desktop-actions` slot content and your `mobile-actions` slot content, and the component handles the rest.

> **Note:** The responsive toolbar will not automatically create a mobile friendly version of your end slot content. You
> should be providing markup for both the `desktop-actions` slot and the `mobile-actions` slot, this lets you fine tune
> the user experience based on available space.

### Why a responsive-toolbar?

The toolbar is a common source of layout issues in back-office applications, often overlooked when adapting to different screen sizes. Managing multiple instances of the core `<forge-toolbar>` across a page can make breakpoint handling complex and inconsistent.

The `<forge-responsive-toolbar>` solves this by automatically adjusting to various screen sizes, preventing hidden content, overlapping text, and broken layouts. It ensures a clean, readable UI without the need for manual breakpoint management.

### When to use a responsive-toolbar

If you know that your application could be potentially used on lower resolutions or mobile devices and you're currently using toolbars with actions in the end slot, then you should use a responsive toolbar instead.
