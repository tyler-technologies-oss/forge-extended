<Title />

The Responsive Toolbar dynamically adjusts your toolbar content to prevent overlap on smaller screens. It leverages a `ResizeObserver` to detect when the title content collides with the end slot content. When an overlap is detected, the toolbar automatically hides the `desktop-actions` slot and displays the `mobile-actions` slot instead.

This approach eliminates the need for manually configuring breakpoints or container queries, ensuring a seamless adaptive experience without extra calculations. Simply provide your `desktop-actions` slot content and your `mobile-actions` slot content, and the component handles the rest.

<br />
> **Note:** The responsive toolbar will not automatically create a mobile friendly version of your end slot content. You
should be providing markup for both the `desktop-actions` slot and the `mobile-actions` slot, this lets you fine tune
the user experience based on available space.

### Why a responsive-toolbar?

The toolbar is a common source of layout issues in back-office applications, often overlooked when adapting to different screen sizes. Managing multiple instances of the core `<forge-toolbar>` across a page can make breakpoint handling complex and inconsistent.

The `<forge-responsive-toolbar>` solves this by automatically adjusting to various screen sizes, preventing hidden content, overlapping text, and broken layouts. It ensures a clean, readable UI without the need for manual breakpoint management.

### When to use a responsive-toolbar

The `<forge-responsive-toolbar>` is useful in applications where you know your primary persona could be on anything from a mobile device, to a tablet, and up to an ultrawide monitor. It's especially useful in backoffice applications that might have multiple actions in the end slot combined with a long title in the start slot. Simply being able to swap between a series of `forge-button` components to a `forge-menu` will completely resolve broken layout issues that can occur at slightly lower than optimal screen resolutions.
