<Title />

The Multi Select Header provides a consistent toolbar interface for displaying selection state and actions when multiple items are selected in data tables, lists, or grids. It builds upon the `<forge-toolbar>` component with a distinctive light blue background to visually indicate an active selection state.

  <forge-icon-button slot="actions" aria-label="Delete selected">

  </forge-icon-button>
</forge-multi-select-header>
```

### With Custom Text

```html
<forge-multi-select-header selected-count="5" selected-text="rows selected for processing"> </forge-multi-select-header>
```

### With Select All Button

```html
<forge-multi-select-header selected-count="3">

</forge-multi-select-header>
```
