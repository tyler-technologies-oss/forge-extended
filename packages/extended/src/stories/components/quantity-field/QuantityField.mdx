<Title />

Quantity fields are used to input a numeric value for a field. They are often used in forms to allow users to increment or decrement a value.

The quantity field is a "decorator" style component, meaning it wraps and enhances the provided `<input>` element with buttons to increment and
decrement the value. You should communicate with the `<input>` as you normally would in terms of getting/setting the value or listening to events,
otherwise the component handles the styling and orchestration of element as a whole.

## Invalid and Required States

The quantity field can be marked as invalid or required by setting the `invalid` or `required` props. The `invalid` prop will add a red border to the
input field, while the `required` prop will add an asterisk to the label. You may be required to also set the `required` attribute on the input field
itself depending on your form validation requirements.
