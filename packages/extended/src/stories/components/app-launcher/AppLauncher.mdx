<Title />

The `<forge-app-launcher>` component is a navigation solution designed for the Tyler Cloud ecosystem, enabling users to easily switch between applications and contexts. It provides a unified interface for accessing both related and all available applications within the Tyler platform, enhancing user workflow and navigation efficiency.

The component adapts responsively to screen size, presenting as a popover on desktop devices and a full-screen dialog on mobile devices to ensure optimal user experience across all platforms.

## Usage

The `<forge-app-launcher>` component is designed to be used within a `<forge-app-bar>`, typically placed in the `end` slot alongside other user-related actions like the user profile component. This ensures consistent navigation structure throughout Tyler Cloud applications.

### App Bar Integration

When using the app launcher within an app bar, you should set the `theme-mode="scoped"` attribute on the `<forge-app-bar>` to ensure proper theming inheritance and prevent the app bar's theme tokens from cascading into the launcher's popover content.

```html
<forge-app-bar theme-mode="scoped">
  <forge-app-launcher slot="end" .allApps="${allApps}" .relatedApps="${relatedApps}">
    <!-- Content slots -->
  </forge-app-launcher>
</forge-app-bar>
```

## Views

The app launcher supports two primary views:

### Related Apps View

The default view showing a curated list of applications relevant to the current user's context. This view includes:

- A list of related applications with icons and labels
- A "View all apps" button to access the complete application catalog
- Optional custom links section for additional resources

### All Apps View

A comprehensive view displaying all available applications with:

- Search functionality to filter applications by name
- Complete list of applications in the Tyler Cloud ecosystem
- Back button to return to the related apps view (when available)

## Custom Links

The component supports custom links through the `<forge-custom-link>` utility component, which provides accessible and visually consistent links within the launcher. Custom links appear in a separate section and are ideal for documentation, FAQ pages, or other supplementary resources.

```html
<forge-app-launcher>
  <span slot="custom-links-title">Resources</span>
  <forge-custom-link slot="custom-link">
    <a href="/documentation" target="_blank">Documentation</a>
  </forge-custom-link>
  <forge-custom-link slot="custom-link">
    <a href="/support" target="_blank">Support Center</a>
  </forge-custom-link>
</forge-app-launcher>
```

## Responsive Behavior

The component automatically adapts to screen size using a configurable media query breakpoint:

- **Desktop (>breakpoint)**: Displays as a popover anchored to the launcher button
- **Mobile (â‰¤breakpoint)**: Displays as a full-screen persistent dialog for optimal touch interaction

The default breakpoint is 768px, but can be customized using the `breakpoint` property:

```html
<!-- Default breakpoint of 768px -->
<forge-app-launcher .allApps="${allApps}"></forge-app-launcher>

<!-- Custom breakpoint of 1024px -->
<forge-app-launcher .allApps="${allApps}" .breakpoint="${1024}"></forge-app-launcher>
```
