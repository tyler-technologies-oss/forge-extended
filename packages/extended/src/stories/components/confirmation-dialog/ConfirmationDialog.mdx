<Title />

A confirmation dialog is a modal component used to present users with a brief message or alert requiring their decision. It typically includes two actions:

- Primary action – The main action that confirms the decision (e.g., "Delete", "Submit", "Confirm").
- Secondary action – An alternative or dismissive action (e.g., "Cancel", "Go back"), allowing users to exit without proceeding.

For succinct alerts (one sentence or less), the dialog title is usually omitted to maintain a clean and focused UI. However, for longer messages or critical actions, a title can provide additional clarity.

> **Note:** Confirmation dialogs display the same in mobile and desktop contexts.
