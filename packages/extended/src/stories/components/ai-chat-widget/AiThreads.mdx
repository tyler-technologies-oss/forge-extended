**_Still in the design phase_**. This component is just getting the basic functionality stubbed out. The AI Threads component provides a sidebar interface for managing conversation threads in AI chat applications. It features a drawer-style navigation with a list of thread items and a main content area.

## Features

- **Sidebar Navigation**: Drawer-style sidebar for thread management
- **Thread List**: Navigation list displaying individual conversation threads
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based layout with left sidebar and main content area
- **Forge Integration**: Uses Forge drawer and list components for consistent styling

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={AiThreadsStories.Demo} />

## Structure

The component consists of two main sections:

### Left Sidebar

- Contains a Forge drawer component
- Displays a navigation list of thread items
- Each thread item is represented as a clickable button

### Right Content Area

- Main content area for displaying thread-specific content
- Currently shows placeholder text "Right side"
- Designed to be populated with actual thread content

## Styling

The component uses:

- **Grid Layout**: Two-column grid with auto-sizing left column and flexible right column
- **Forge Components**: Integrates `forge-drawer` and `forge-list` components
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using Forge spacing tokens
- **Typography**: Forge typography styles for text content

## Future Enhancements

This component is currently a basic implementation and can be extended with:

- Dynamic thread data loading
- Thread selection handling
- Thread creation and deletion
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Thread metadata display (date, message count, etc.)
- Drag and drop reordering

## Accessibility

- Uses semantic HTML structure with proper navigation elements
- Integrates with Forge components that include built-in accessibility features
- Keyboard navigation supported through standard list and button interactions
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA attributes from Forge components
