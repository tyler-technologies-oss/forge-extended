# Tyler Forge™ Extended [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-extended)](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-extended/)

The Tyler Forge™ Extended library is a set of high quality, accessible UI components that are built on top of the core/atomic
Tyler Forge™ components. These components are typically larger, more complex, and encapsulate a larger pattern or design to
help developers create user interfaces more efficiently. The main focus of these components is strict design and accessibility,
and they are intended to offer limited volatility. The components in this library are intended to be used in conjunction with
the core Tyler Forge library.

## Usage

To get started, install both the core Tyler Forge library and the extended library (if the core library is already installed,
see version compatibility table below):

```bash
npm install @tylertech/forge @tylertech/forge-extended
```

> The `@tylertech/forge` library is a peer dependency of the extended library, and they are very tightly coupled and intended
> to always be used alongside each other.
>
> See the [Forge documentation](https://forge.tylerdev.io/) for more information on the core library.
