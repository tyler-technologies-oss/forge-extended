# Tyler Forge™ Extended [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-extended)](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-extended/)

The Tyler Forge™ Extended library is a set of high quality, accessible UI components that are built on top of the primitive
[Tyler Forge™ components](https://forge.tylerdev.io/). These components are typically larger, more complex, and encapsulate
a larger pattern or design to help developers create user interfaces more efficiently. The main focus of these components is
strict design and accessibility, and they are intended to offer limited volatility. The components in this library are
intended to be used in conjunction with the core Tyler Forge library.
